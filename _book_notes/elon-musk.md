What can we learn from Elon?

- Be insanely ambitious
    - The most ambitious visions — grand missions for humanity — attract the most talented and driven people
    - Not only accept risk as a necessary component of ambition and something to be mitigated, but maximize it. Put all your chips on the table again, and again: self-fund SpaceX from PayPal exit money, use all remaining funds on a last launch attempt after 3 failed launches during 2008 crisis, self-fund Tesla on personal loans during 2008 to keep it afloat, start Starship risking bankrupting SpaceX just when Falcon 9 was finally commercially successful, go all in on Trump, etc.
    - Peter Thiel: Maybe Elon understands something about risk that nobody else does? 
    - My take: Willingness to take the most risk = Ability to tackle the most ambitious visions with almost no competition

- But always pragmatic
    - Always backtrack to a practical sustainable business: start with upscale Roadster and Model S for Tesla, Starlink for SpaceX, medical applications for disabled people for Neuralink, etc.
    - Blind idealism without grounding in reality gets nothing done

- Simplify / delete requirements
    - The only true requirements are dictated by the laws of physics
    - Always attach a person’s name to any requirement
    - Delete requirements to the brink of viability - if you don’t add back 10%, you probably didn’t delete enough: stainless steel Starship, Tesla manufacturing lines, Neuralink as a single device, Twitter staff cuts, etc

- Cultivate a maniacal sense of urgency
    - Regularly rally the team around quasi impossible objectives: Tesla model 3 "production hell" to ramp up to 5000 units per week, Optimus robot launch, self-driving launch, etc.
    - Lead by example: be on the ground with the team working harder than anyone: sleeping in factory and touring lines every day for Tesla, in the jungle next to the launch pad for Starship, etc.
    - This is the most effective way to combat inertia:
        - Motivates everyone by showing them how much they can accomplish
        - Builds team cohesion in adversity
        - Prunes low intensity team members
    - On the flip side, great people sometimes burn out and leave. But they also often look back thinking it was the best work of their life
    - Pretty similar to Steve Jobs’ reality distortion field

- Deeply understand engineering fundamentals and get deeply involved in the details
    - Time and time again, Elon drives major engineering decisions himself, applying his algorithm to delete requirements: pushing for reusable rockets, stainless steel Starship, vertically integrating Tesla manufacturing, simplifying every detail of the Model 3 production lines, etc.
    - And regularly working directly with / micro-managing teams on the ground
    - Also pretty similar to Steve Job's obsessive focus on getting every detail right
