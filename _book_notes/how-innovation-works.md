## Innovation as an evolutionary process

Differentiate invention from innovation
  - **Invention** is the original creative act of coming up with something new, usually based on a **new understanding of the world (new knowledge)** through the scientific method
  - **Innovation** implies developing an invention to the point where it is **used at scale** because it is **sufficiently practical, reliable, and affordable** to be worth using

Innovation is the workhorse of the progress we’ve witnessed since the Enlightenment, but it is a poorly understood process - why and how does it happen?

Innovation as an evolutionary process
- Unit of selection: a technology is an idea manifested as a product or service
- Variation
    - The usual process of variation in idea evolution: make a conjecture (see David Deutsch), manifested as **building a product or offering a service**
    - Concretely: copy and tweak the leading technology, combine multiple different technologies, incorporate customer feedback
- Selection
    - The usual process of selection in idea evolution: experiments and criticism (see David Deutsch), manifested as **feedback from customer use**
    - Concretely: customer feedback on the product or service to select features, customer choice between different products or services to select products/services
    - This feedback loop is a fundamental feature of innovation that **grounds technology into what is useful to people**

Examples of innovations that followed an evolutionary process (with detailed accounts in the book)
- Energy and transportation: the steam engine, fracking, the locomotive and railway, the internal combustion engine and car, the plane
- Health: vaccination (inoculation), water chlorination, antibiotics (penicillin), mosquito bed nets
- Food: synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, genetically modified crops
- Computing: the computer, the personal computer, the smartphone, ever shrinking transistors (Moor’s law), the Internet, search engines, social media, machine learning

In contrast
- Nuclear fission power failed to follow an evolutionary process as variation under increasing regulation was too costly
- Genetically modified crops, although extremely safe, failed in Europe under activism ungrounded in facts and regulatory pressure

## Features of innovation as an evolutionary process

- Innovation is a **gradual and messy process by trial and error** that involves **many different innovators**, both scientists and entrepreneurs and their teams
    - We can rarely single out a single breakthrough moment of invention or a single inventor in the history of a technology
    - Because it is a process of trial and error, it **requires a culture of experimentation and failure** - the Silicon Valley startup culture or Amazon’s culture of experimentation with a history of many failed products
- Technology is **recombinant**: innovations combine existing building blocks
    - This makes it a compounding process: the more (and more complex) building blocks there are to evolve from, the faster the rate of improvement
    - It explains why innovation historically happened in trading hubs where ideas could most effectively be shared
- Technology **adoption and rate of improvement follows a wave pattern (an S-curve)**
    - Slow take-off followed by increasingly fast pace through a virtuous cycle of customer use leading to more practical, reliable, and affordable iterations on the technology, in turn appealing to more customers, until market saturation
    - We often **overlook technologies as toys** because they undershoot user needs at the beginning of the S-curve
    - When we’re convinced a technology is not a toy, we often **overestimate its pace of improvement in the short term and underestimate it in the long term** because we fit a line to the S-curve
    - A technological wave often builds on meta-waves (general purpose technologies)
- The **most widely used technology improves fastest** because it attracts the most R&D attention, which brings further customer usage
    - This rich get richer effect explains winner-takes-all dynamics: beyond network effects, simply being perceived as the market leader attracts risk-averse users and third-party development effort (integrations, etc.)
    - It is also present in academia: the most cited paper on a topic gets read and cited because it is the most cited paper
- **Technology evolution is accelerating** due to
    - More technologies to build from and recombine
    - More people innovating (in the recent past, China in particular)
    - Better tools to accelerate processes of variation and selection: the personal computer, the Internet, and AI
    - A refined understanding and operationalization of the innovation process through the VC industry and the modern startup ecosystem: iterative rounds of funding to de-risk ventures, the lean methodology with emphasis on customer feedback, strong localized networks of builders, investors, early adopters, and acquirers
    - Feedback loops in the evolutionary process (e.g., AI helping to design chips)
- **Technology development and use often precedes and demands scientific understanding**
    - It is a two-way relationship, as opposed to the one-directional path from science to technology many have in mind
    - Steam engines preceded thermodynamics, powered flight preceded almost all aerodynamics, animal and plant breeding preceded genetics
    - The practice of inoculation/vaccination and antibiotics long preceded the understanding of why they work
    - Neural networks have revolutionized AI, but we still have a very limited understanding of why they work
- Innovation is a **bottom-up process**
    - The government is usually a secondary actor in the evolution process, most of the evolution happens in the private sector through market competition
    - China today is a workhorse of innovation because of the laissez-faire attitude of the government towards ambitious entrepreneurs; innovation will halt when this changes
    - Europe today is slow to innovate because of the regulatory burden on entrepreneurs and the lack of a culture of entrepreneurial experimentation and failure; the latter is changing for the better but the former is not
- Innovation **increases interdependence**: we are more specialized in what we produce but more general in what we consume
