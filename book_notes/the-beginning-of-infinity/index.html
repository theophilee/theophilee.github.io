<strong>four fundamental disciplines, all necessary and interdependent</strong> to understand the world</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Quantum physics</strong> is the deepest language of physics in which all other theories are laid out and the basis of understanding our physical universe</li> <li> <strong>Evolution</strong> is the theory of what processes in nature keep themselves into existence <ul> <li>It is the theory of replicators (genes and ideas)</li> <li>It explains how large objects - life and thought processes creating knowledge - can be understood in terms that do not follow from their low-level definitions in terms of physics (emergence)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Computation</strong> is the theory of what processes in nature are independent of the material substance that they are embodied in <ul> <li>Turing’s universality of computation implies that a physical computer can simulate any physical reality</li> <li>This is the best explanation for the fact that physical reality can be understood by itself: think of the collective of human brains and our tools (including computers) as the universal computer and our best explanations of physical reality as the simulation</li> <li>The only limits on humanity’s ability to influence the universe are the laws of physics</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Epistemology</strong> is the theory of what constitutes knowledge and how to acquire it <ul> <li>A good philosophy of knowledge is the cornerstone of human knowledge creation</li> <li>Knowledge is information that is useful, it has the property that it tends to keep itself instantiated</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>How are the theories interdependent? The central narrative is that <strong>our physical universe is on the path to understanding itself through human knowledge creation</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>The creation of knowledge - first by biological evolution until humans (life), then by idea evolution (thought) - explains how this universe comes to understand itself first by genes getting organisms to pass them on by reproduction and then ideas getting humans to pass them on by dialogue</li> <li>Computation explains why this is possible through the Turing principle, justifying optimism about the beginning of infinity: humans are on the path to creating infinite knowledge and impacting the universe (multiverse) more than anything has ever before</li> <li>Note that for this to happen, the fabric of reality should be and is layered for easy self-access: life and thought evolution processes must be efficient, they cannot require too much time or other resources</li> </ul> <p>This worldview is <strong>fundamentally optimistic - it places human minds at the center of the physical universe, and explanation and understanding at the center of human purpose</strong></p> <p><strong>Only infinite progress by knowledge creation</strong> is sustainable for our species to thrive</p> <ul> <li>Problems are inevitable, and the greatest dangers are unforeseen (e.g., global warming in the 70s)</li> <li>But soluble - every transformation that is not forbidden by the laws of physics is achievable given the right knowledge</li> <li>If we fail at anything, it will be because of knowledge that we fail to create</li> </ul> <h2 id="the-beginning-of-infinity">The Beginning of Infinity</h2> <h3 id="extension-of-poppers-definition-of-knowledge-creation">Extension of Popper’s definition of knowledge creation</h3> <p><strong>Theory (explanations) comes before observations</strong> - acquiring knowledge is a creative process to come up with our best guesses to explain reality and iteratively criticize them</p> <ul> <li>Good explanations address all current criticisms and explain phenomena better than alternatives</li> <li>They make testable predictions - more broadly, beyond Science, in philosophy or mathematics, they are <strong>criticizable</strong> </li> <li>But it’s not only about predictions but also about the explanation itself - it must be <strong>hard to vary</strong>: all of its components are necessary</li> <li>Explanations that are hard to vary are hard to come by, and often make precise and risky predictions</li> </ul> <p>This definition of knowledge creation <strong>explains the need for emergence</strong>: independent levels of understanding like atomic physics, fluid dynamics, or human behavior</p> <ul> <li>Particle collisions explain everything, so they explain nothing, just like God explains everything, so it explains nothing, they’re not useful levels to operate at</li> <li>We shouldn’t discount fundamental theories that emerge as good explanations just because we can’t lay them down in the language of physics; emergent explanations are very often the only known good explanations</li> </ul> <p>A <strong>bad philosophy</strong> is a philosophy whose effect is to close off the growth of knowledge:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Empiricism</strong> (and pushed to the extreme, positivism) is the theory that we gain knowledge only through observing the world - this makes no sense: without formulating a conjecture, we don’t even know what to observe or how to interpret it</li> <li> <strong>Instrumentalism</strong> is the theory that Science is only about predictions - this makes no sense: even if we had an oracle that could give us the outcomes of any experiments, we wouldn’t know how to use it without formulating hypotheses/explanations to decide what experiments to run</li> </ul> <h3 id="ideas-like-genes-evolve-via-iterative-competition-by-variation-and-selection">Ideas (like genes) evolve via iterative competition by variation and selection</h3> <p>Knowledge is <strong>information that is useful</strong>, information that can affect the physical world towards an objective. It is <strong>a replicator: it has the property of keeping itself physically instantiated</strong>. There are <strong>only two types of knowledge</strong>:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th> </th> <th><strong>Evolutionary</strong></th> <th><strong>Explanatory</strong></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Unit of selection</td> <td>Gene</td> <td>Idea/explanation</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Storage place</td> <td>DNA of living organisms</td> <td>Human brains and behaviors</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Variation</td> <td>Random mutations</td> <td>New creative explanations <br> Imperfect communication from one mind to another</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Communication</td> <td>Sexual reproduction of holder’s organism</td> <td>Communication from holder’s mind to another mind</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Selection</td> <td>Competition with other genes <br> Via survival and reproduction pressure from the environment</td> <td>Competition with other ideas/explanations <br> Via criticism and experimentation in a dynamic society <br> Via conformity and dogmatism in a static society</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Reach</td> <td>Low: local to an organism and environment</td> <td>High: our best explanations explain well beyond the phenomena that prompted them</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Speed of evolution</td> <td>Extremely slow <br> Blind random mutations <br> At the pace of generations <br> Credit assignment problem</td> <td>Extremely fast and accelerating <br> Many times in one generation <br> Can benefit from human tools for faster variation, communication, and criticism: personal computer, Internet, personal AI</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><br> For most of human history before the Enlightenment, societies were largely <strong>static</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>They had customs and laws suppressing criticism of the status quo and creative and critical faculties of their members by valuing conformity, obedience, piety, and devotion to duty</li> <li>They evolved at the pace of centuries, and even worse, the selection of ideas was flawed: false and harmful ideas were likely to be propagated because conformity was valued over criticism</li> <li>The Enlightenment was characterized by a rejection of authority, dogma, and any system of belief that insulated itself against criticism and change - this led to an explosion in explanatory knowledge</li> </ul> <p>Since then, modern <strong>dynamic</strong> societies have embraced change, creativity, and criticism:</p> <ul> <li>Ideas with the best chance of survival at scale across varied contexts are truths with reach (like the laws of physics), which survive criticism</li> <li>Given knowledge acquisition is an error-correcting mechanism, <strong>not destroying the means of error correction via criticism and experimentation might be our best basis for morality</strong> (optimizing for humanity’s flourishing) - doing so would be negating our biggest advantage as a species</li> </ul> <p>How did creativity - defined as the ability to come up with explanations - evolve while societies remained static? Deutsch’s explanation:</p> <ul> <li>It is necessary to propagate existing ideas and behaviors, not just to create new ones - humans explain other’s ideas and behaviors to learn them; they don’t just mimic like other species (apes, parrots); thinking otherwise would be the same misconception as empiricism</li> <li>In static societies, it was used to infer intentions behind behaviors to more accurately enact the prevailing dogmas</li> <li>This ability of human brains to explain evolved to propagate ideas, becoming more and more universal, and ended up enabling the creation of new ones - it is necessary and sufficient to propagate ideas and has an incredible reach because it enables the creation of new ones</li> <li>This is what makes humanity special: <strong>we are creative universal explainers</strong> - it is partly hardware (genetic adaptations of brains) and partly software (an appreciation for creativity and criticism)</li> <li>Given explanatory knowledge evolution is incredibly more efficient than evolutionary knowledge evolution, <strong>recorded history is largely the history of ideas, and so will the future of the universe</strong> </li> </ul> <p>Humans play a special role in the universe</p> <ul> <li>To understand everything that happens on Earth (why Einstein is taken to Sweden and given some gold), aliens would need to understand everything there is to know about the world (general relativity, philosophy, morality) - knowledge impacts the world more than anything else</li> <li>The <strong>things that create knowledge (evolution and humans) are necessary in any explanations of the world</strong>; this is the definition of being significant</li> </ul> </div> </article> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2023 Theophile Gervet. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha256-fgLAgv7fyCGopR/gBNq2iW3ZKIdqIcyshnUULC4vex8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@4/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.0.8/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-7PhEpEWEW0XXQ0k6kQrPKwuoIomz8R8IYyuU1Qew4P8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/afeld/bootstrap-toc/v1.0.1/dist/bootstrap-toc.min.js"></script> <script defer src="https://unpkg.com/bootstrap-table@1.21.4/dist/bootstrap-table.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script> <script defer src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script> <script type="text/javascript">function progressBarSetup(){"max"in document.createElement("progress")?(initializeProgressElement(),$(document).on("scroll",function(){progressBar.attr({value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}),$(window).on("resize",initializeProgressElement)):(resizeProgressBar(),$(document).on("scroll",resizeProgressBar),$(window).on("resize",resizeProgressBar))}function getCurrentScrollPosition(){return $(window).scrollTop()}function initializeProgressElement(){let e=$("#navbar").outerHeight(!0);$("body").css({"padding-top":e}),$("progress-container").css({"padding-top":e}),progressBar.css({top:e}),progressBar.attr({max:getDistanceToScroll(),value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}function getDistanceToScroll(){return $(document).height()-$(window).height()}function resizeProgressBar(){progressBar.css({width:getWidthPercentage()+"%"})}function getWidthPercentage(){return getCurrentScrollPosition()/getDistanceToScroll()*100}const progressBar=$("#progress");window.onload=function(){setTimeout(progressBarSetup,50)};</script> </body> </html>
