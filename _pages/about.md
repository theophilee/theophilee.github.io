I'm a research scientist at [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/), working on accelerating AI open-source. I believe progress on language models as cultural technologies is currently our best lever on the rate of human progress. [Accelerate with us!](http://jobs.lever.co/mistral)

Before that, I was doing an ML PhD at Carnegie Mellon University, working on computer vision and robotics with [Katerina Fragkiadaki](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~katef). 

Even before that, I was working on reinforcement learning (RL) with [Doina Precup](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/index.html) and [Joelle Pineau](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau) at McGill in Montreal. 
Early in my PhD, I worked on offline RL for education with [Tom Mitchell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/). 
I took a couple of years of leave to build the ML product & team of [Relyance AI](https://www.relyance.ai/).

I grew up in Paris, and my English accent has long been stuck at a local optimum.
I like good food and wine, traveling, nature, and lifting weights while listening to cool science or philosophy.
